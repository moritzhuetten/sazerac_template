martin.habedank@desy.de,Martin,Habedank,Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (DESY),,,,3B,0,Wed 1.12.,1000,Sensitivity of LHC Measurements to Two Higgs Doublet Models with a Pseudoscalar Mediator,"A fairly minimal and thus attractive approach to the Dark Matter puzzle is offered by two Higgs doublet models with a pseudoscalar mediator coupling to the Standard Model and to a new stable, neutral particle. While these models have gained increasing attention by the LHC search programme, the sensitivity of existing LHC measurements has not been as rigorously explored. In this talk, studies employing the CONTUR toolkit to determine the impact of these measurements in commonly addressed benchmark regions will be presented and comparisons to LHC search combinations drawn. Extending the considered parameter ranges and relaxing prevalent assumptions, first constraints on so far unprobed scenarios will be shown. For each case, it will be highlighted how New Physics processes are affected and which of those should have significantly impacted existing LHC measurements.","Collider searches, Contributed talk, Session"
dishabhatia1989@gmail.com,Disha,Bhatia,IMSc,,,,3B,0,Wed 1.12.,1005,Phenomenological analysis of multi-pseudoscalar mediated dark matter models,"A plethora of non-minimal simplified models have gained considerable importance for the dark matter searches at LHC as they predict enhanced signatures for
mono-Higgs and mono-W/Z studies over mono-jets over parts of the parameter space.
However these non-minmal models, are model dependent and lack the (simplicity) clarity
of the simplified models. In this work, we describe these non-minimal models on the basis
of the additional mediator and dark matter particles, which makes the classification model
independent. As an example, we consider a set-up featuring two pseudo-scalar mediators
and a SM-singlet fermionic dark matter χ. We determine regions of the parameter space
where the effects of the second mediator becomes important. The relic density constraint
combined with indirect detection leaves allowed space close to the resonance regions, which will be nearly probed at the future higher integrated runs of the LHC at 95% C.L.. Transitions from radiation domination to matter domination opens up more parameter space
for the WIMP candidates.","Collider searches, Contributed talk, Session"
shohei.nishida@kek.jp,Shohei,Nishida,KEK,,,,3B,0,Wed 1.12.,1035,Dark Matter Search at Belle and Belle II,"Belle is an experiment at KEKB e+ e- collider for the study of flavor physics using large amount of B mesons. It was operated in 1999-2010 and is now upgraded to Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB collider. These data can be used to search for dark matters up to a few GeV. Search for the dark gauge bozon Z' that couples only to heavy leptons is performed in the process e+ e- -> Z' mu+ mu-, Z' -> mu+ mu- at Belle. Similar search for the invisible decay of a Z' is performed using initial data of Belle II. Other studies including search for axion-like particles in e+e- collisions at Belle II and search for B meson decays into Lambda baryon and missing energy, which provides limits with implications for baryognesis and dark matter production, are also reported. Future prospect on the dark matter search with Belle II is also presented.","Collider searches, Contributed talk, Session"

In this model, the SM is minimally extended by three new states: A scalar leptoquark, a Dirac colored fermion and a Majorana fermion that plays the role of dark matter candidate. After reviewing the relevant collider and dark matter constraints, I discuss few benchmark scenarios amenable to discovery at the HL-LHC or FCC-hh","Collider searches, Contributed talk, Session"
a.h.dekker@uva.nl,Ariane,Dekker,GRAPPA - University of Amsterdam,,,,1B,0,Mon 29.11.,1105,Warm dark matter constraints using indirect searches,"Warm dark matter (WDM) could explain some small scale structure observations that have challenged the cold dark matter (CDM) model, as warm particles suppress structure formation due to free streaming effects. Observing small-scale structure thus provides a valuable way to distinguish between CDM and WDM. In this talk, I will present a semi-analytical model for dark matter substructure evolution. Satellite galaxies form within dark matter subhalos, and I will discuss constraints on WDM models based on the observed number of satellites in the Milky Way.
Moreover, WDM particles such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles can decay into photons, which are consequently detectable by X-ray telescopes. eROSITA will perform an all-sky X-ray survey, and I will present its sensitivity to identify dark matter decay with narrow X-ray line emission.","Dark Matter astrophysics, Contributed talk, Session"
danengy@ucr.edu,Daneng,Yang,"University of California, Riverside",,,,1B,0,Mon 29.11.,1120,Searching for dark matter self-interactions in tidally formed    ultra-diffuse galaxies and cluster substructures,"Cold dark matter can be interacting rather frequently at dense regions of galaxies. It has been shown that these interactions could provide explanations for several small-scale anomalies. In recent years, small-scale observations continue to challenge our understanding of the nature of dark matter: two ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4, are found to be deficient in dark matter, and the number of small-scale lenses seems to be excess in number in massive clusters. In this talk, we present some of our works related to these observations. We show that self-interacting dark matter can be consistent with these very different observations, and in some cases, provide more natural explanations. Its interesting interplay with other aspects of galaxy evolution is worthy of further exploration.","Dark Matter astrophysics, Contributed talk, Session"
jchan@astr.tohoku.ac.jp,Jowett,Chan,"Astronomical Institute, Tohoku University",,,,1A,0,Mon 29.11.,1200,The diversity of core-halo structure in the Fuzzy Dark Matter model ,"In simulations of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) model, we always found gravitationally collapsed object composed of a solitonic core locating within a virialized halo, but there is still an inconsistency on the core mass-halo mass relation between different groups. To fully understand the relation, we have performed idealized soliton mergers and cosmological FDM simulation by solving the time-dependent Schrodinger-Poisson equation. We obtained large samples of core-halo structure which allows us to directly compare with the core-halo relation of previous works. We found a diversity in the core-halo structure, that is manifested in the scatter of core-halo mass relation. We provided a simple empirical equation with uncertainty that encompasses all relations found by previous groups. We suggest that the origin of the diversity maybe related to the environmental effect, such as tidal stripping, which requires simulations with more efficient numerical scheme to confirm.","Dark Matter theory, Contributed talk, Session"
hirosima@sci.u-toyama.ac.jp,Nagisa,Hiroshima,University of Toyama,,,,1A,0,Mon 29.11.,1215,WIMP annihilation signals in dwarf spheroidal galaxies as subhalos of the Milky Way,"Dwarf spheroidal galaxies that form in halo substructures provide stringent constraints on dark matter annihilation. Many ultrafaint dwarfs discovered with modern surveys contribute significantly to these constraints. At present, because of the lack of abundant stellar kinematic data for the ultrafaints, non-informative prior assumptions are usually made for the parameters of the density profiles. Based on semi-analytic models of dark matter subhalos and their connection to satellite galaxies, we present more informative and realistic satellite priors. We show that our satellite priors lead to constraints on the annihilation rate that are between a factor of 2 and a factor of 7 weaker than under non-informative priors. As a result, the thermal relic cross section can at best only be excluded (with 95% probability) for dark matter masses of ≲40 GeV from dwarf spheroidal data, assuming annihilation into bb¯.

lingfeng_li@brown.edu,Lingfeng,Li,Brown University,,,,1A,0,Mon 29.11.,1230,Supperheavy Dark Matter and Its Cosmological Collider Signal,"We discuss two possible scenarios, namely the curvaton mechanism and the dark matter density modulation, where non-Gaussianity signals of superheavy dark matter produced by gravity can be enhanced and observed. In both scenarios, superheavy dark matter couples to an additional light field as a mediator. In the case of derivative coupling, the resulting non-Gaussianities induced by the light field can be large, which can provide inflationary evidences for these superheavy dark matter scenarios.","Dark Matter theory, Contributed talk, Session"

In order to directly detect the hypothetical flux of Dark Matter particles streaming through the Earth, there are many experimental efforts utilizing highly sensitive, low-background detectors.
Following up on the previous successful operations at Stanford, California, and Soudan, Minnesota, the SuperCDMS collaboration is currently constructing a Generation-2 cryogenic Dark Matter experiment at the SNOLAB underground facility in Sudbury, Canada.  
The main objective of SuperCDMS is a search for light Dark Matter particles with masses below 10 GeV.
The experiment will employ two types of state-of-the-art cryogenic Ge and Si detectors capable of detecting sub-keV energy depositions from potential Dark Matter interactions.
By making use of the complementary detector designs and substrate materials, a broadband Dark Matter search can be performed.

This talk will present an overview of our phonon and charge sensor based detector technology, as well as the ongoing efforts in building the SuperCDMS experiment at SNOLAB.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
physicsoumya@gmail.com,Soumya,Sadhukhan,"Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (Autonomous), Kolkata, West Bengal",,,,NN,0,,1300,Neutrino Floor in Leptophilic $U(1)$ Models: Modification in U(1)_{L_mu -L_tau},"Here we investigate the beyond standard model (BSM) impact of leptophilic U(1) models, on coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS), affecting dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments. Imposing the latest relevant experimental constraints on these models, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(50\%)$ enhancement for case of $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ in a region $m_Z' \approx 20~$MeV. Subsequently, we observe that the enhancement seen in CE$\nu$NS is roughly getting translated to enhancement by a factor of 2.7 (for Germanium based detectors) and 1.8 (for Xenon based detectors) in the neutrino scattering event rate which eventually enhances the neutrino floor by same amount. This enhancement is more prominent in the region with DM masses less than 10 GeV. The model parameter space that leads to this enhancement, can simultaneously explain both anomalous magnetic moment of muon ($(g-2)_{\mu}$) and observed DM relic density, in a modified scenario.

yu.watanabe@ipmu.jp,Yu,Watanabe,University of Tokyo,,,,NN,0,,1000,Thermal Real Scalar Triplet Dark Matter,"Real scalar triplet dark matter, which is known to be an attractive candidate for a thermal WIMP, is comprehensively studied paying particular attention to the Sommerfeld effect on the dark matter annihilation caused by the weak interaction and the other interaction between the dark matter and the Higgs boson. We find a parameter region that includes the so-called 'WIMP-Miracle' one is still surviving, i.e. it respects all constraints imposed by dark matter searches at collider experiments, underground experiments (direct detection) and astrophysical observations (indirect detection). The region is also found to be efficiently searched for by various near future experiments. In particular, the XENONnT experiment will cover almost the entire parameter region.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
Toshi.Sumida@cern.ch,Toshi,Sumida,Kyoto University,,,,NN,0,,1030,DOSUE-RR - experiment to explore ultra-light CDM in the millimeter-wave range,"Dark photon is one of the CDM candidates. It is predicted that the dark photons are converted to the standard model photons at the surface of the metal plate. DOSUE-RR (Dark-photon Observing System for Un-Explored Radio-Range) is a set of experiments to search for the conversion photon in millimeter-wave range. The target mass region ranges from 10^-4 to 10^-3 eV, with different techniques optimized for corresponding frequencies.

In this talk we first report the current status on the ongoing measurement in 16 - 26 GHz(K-band). The power of the conversion photons is expected to be low (< 10^-19 W/cm^2). Thus, it is important to reduce thermal radiation as major noise in this experiment. We present the experimental apparatus in cryogenic conditions (~4 K) and expected sensitivity with optimizations.

Then we introduce another experiment with the methods used to measure the CMB anisotropy in 10-18 GHz(J-band).  This range will be searched with three antennas in order to be sensitive to the polarization and velocity distribution in the Milky Way Galaxy.

Finally future prospects for a measurement in higher mass (frequency) regions are presented. ","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
psanchez@physik.uzh.ch,Patricia,Sanchez-Lucas,University of Zurich,,,,NN,0,,1045,DARWIN: a next-generation time projection chamber,"Most promising detectors to search for particle dark matter are the xenon dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs). This technology is by now well-established and can be scaled up to ton-scale. The DARWIN collaboration intends to build a next-generation dual-phase TPC which will operate 50t of natural xenon and whose main goal will be to explore the parameter space for WIMPs down to the irreducible neutrino interactions. This large detector will have a low energy threshold and an ultra-low background level, offering  also an excellent environment to probe neutrino physics and look for other rare interactions. This includes, among others, an impressive sensitivity to low-energy solar neutrinos and to the neutrinoless double-beta decay of Xe-136. We discuss here the concept of DARWIN, the sensitivity to different physics channels and the ongoing R&D effort.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
vermeulensm@cardiff.ac.uk,Sander,Vermeulen,Cardiff University,,,,NN,0,,1100,Direct limits for scalar field dark matter from a gravitational-wave detector ,"We report on the first direct search for scalar field dark matter utilising a gravitational-wave detector. Scalar field dark matter is predicted to cause oscillations of fundamental constants, which in turn would drive oscillations of the size and index of refraction of the beamsplitter in an interferometer. This would thus produce an oscillatory signal in a gravitational-wave detector at a frequency set by the mass of the dark matter particle. We set new upper limits for the coupling constants of scalar field dark matter as a function of its mass, by excluding the presence of possible dark matter signals in data from the GEO600 interferometer. The new constraints improve upon bounds from previous direct searches by more than six orders of magnitude, and are in some cases more stringent than limits obtained in tests of the equivalence principle by up to four orders of magnitude. Our work demonstrates that scalar field dark matter can be probed or constrained with direct searches using gravitational-wave detectors, and highlights the potential of quantum-enhanced interferometry for dark matter detection.

AielloL@cardiff.ac.uk,Lorenzo,Aiello,Cardiff University,,,,NN,0,,1115,Constraints on scalar field dark matter from co-located Michelson interferometers,"Low-mass (sub-eV) scalar field dark matter may induce apparent oscillations of fundamental constants, resulting in corresponding oscillations of the size and the index of refraction of solids. Laser interferometers are highly sensitive to changes in the size and index of refraction of the main beamsplitter. Using data of the Fermilab Holometer instrument, which consists of twin co-located 40-m arm length power-recycled interferometers, we investigate the possible existence of scalar field
dark matter candidates, setting new upper limits for the coupling parameters of scalar field dark matter and improving on limits from previous direct searches.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
tnitta1@uw.edu,Tatsumi,Nitta,University of Washington,,,,NN,0,,1145,Latest Results and Beyond from ADMX ,"The axion is an excellent candidate for dark matter arising from the Peccei-Quinn solution to the Strong-CP problem. The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) searches for axion dark matter with a resonant cavity immersed in a magnetic field. The previous ADMX results achieved sensitivity to the DFSZ axions in the 2.7-3.3 micro eV with ultra-low noise RF readout realized by quantum amplifiers and a dilution refrigerator. In this presentation, we will report the latest results from a search for the axion dark matter in the 3.3-4.2 micro eV mass range. Furthermore, we will talk about improvements for the next data-taking operation.","Direct Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
alessandro.montanari@cea.fr,Alessandro,Montanari,CEA-Saclay/Irfu-DPhP/University Paris Saclay,,,,4A,0,Thu 2.12.,1200,Searching for dark matter annihilation signals with the H.E.S.S. Inner Galaxy Survey ,"Plenty of astrophysical and cosmological measurements suggests the presence of dark matter (DM) in the Universe. Nevertheless, its nature is still a mystery. One of the most promising paradigms explains dark matter as made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs): particles with mass and coupling strength at the electroweak scale, thermally produced in the early universe and having present relic density consistent with that observed today. Gamma-rays are one of the possible final states of WIMP self-annihilation. The brightest source of DM annihilation is predicted to be the centre of the Milky Way, which has been surveyed in the last years by the H.E.S.S. telescopes array. The Inner Galaxy Survey (IGS) aims to achieve the best sensitivity to faint and diffuse emissions in the inner halo of the Milky Way. We analyzed 550 hours of observations taken between 2014 and 2020 with the five H.E.S.S. telescopes to search for a DM annihilation signal. No significant excess is found, therefore we derived strong constraints on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section of dark matter particles. Thermal WIMPs in the TeV mass range can be probed in different annihilation channels. ","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
michailidis@astro.uni-tuebingen.de,Miltiadis,Michailidis,University of Tuebingen (IAAT),,,,4A,0,Thu 2.12.,1215,CTA prospects for annihilating dark matter from observations of nearby spiral galaxies,"M31 and M33 are the closest spiral galaxies and the largest members (together with the Milky Way) of the Local group, which makes them interesting targets for indirect DM searches. In this paper we present studies of the expected sensitivity of the CTA to an annihilation signal from weakly interacting massive particles from M31 and M33. We show  that a 100 h long observation campaign will allow CTA to probe annihilation cross-sections up to〈συ〉≈5·10^(−25) cm^3 s^(−1) for the ττ annihilation channel (for M31, at 0.3 TeV), improving the current limits derived by HAWC by up to an order of magnitude. Aiming at a robust estimate of the expected sensitivity, we discuss the contributions of the astrophysical background and other possible sources of systematic uncertainty to the expected sensitivity of the CTA to DM signal. In addition, we show that the CTA might be able to detect the extended emission from the bulge of M31, detected at lower energies by the Fermi/LAT. If the spectrum of the bulge extended into the TeV energy range following a power law with slope > −2.3 and pivot energy 1.5 GeV (consistent with Fermi/LAT), CTA could detect the object with a statistical significance of 5σ.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
regis.mrc@gmail.com,Marco,Regis,University of Torino and INFN,,,,4B,0,Thu 2.12.,1230,Searching for WIMPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"We present a radio search for WIMP dark matter in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We make use of a recent deep image of the LMC obtained from observations of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and processed as part of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey. LMC is an extremely promising target for WIMP searches at radio frequencies because of the large J-factor and the presence of a substantial magnetic field. We detect no evidence for emission arising from WIMP annihilations and derive stringent bounds. This work excludes the thermal cross section for masses below 480 GeV and annihilation into quarks.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
yamatani.masahiro@jaxa.jp,Masahiro,Yamatani,JAXA,,,,4A,0,Thu 2.12.,1245,Antiparticles identification study for the GAPS experiment,"The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a balloon-borne instrument that aims to measure low-energy cosmic-ray antiparticles, such as antideuterons. Well-motivated BSM theories predict a relatively high antideuteron flux from dark matter annihilation or decay, especially in the kinetic energy range below 0.25 GeV/n, where it can exceed the secondary antideuteron flux by more than two orders of magnitude. GAPS has established a new sensitive particle identification method based on exotic atoms formed by incident antiparticles, using a 10-layer of Si(Li) detector tracker with two layers of time-of-flight (ToF). Particle identification with high background rejection power is crucial for the sensitive antideuterons search since the yield of background, mainly from antiprotons, can be more than three orders of magnitude larger than antideuterons. To ensure the quality of particle identification, we are working on machine-learning-based techniques, including primary β reconstruction with RNN and non-biased particle identification by three-dimensional CNN. This presentation will provide a brief overview of the GAPS and the recent studies for antideuteron identification.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
o.a.maciasramirez@uva.nl,Oscar,Macias,University of Amsterdam,,,,4B,0,Thu 2.12.,1305,Assessing the Impact of Hydrogen Absorption on the Characteristics of the Galactic Center Excess,"We present a new reconstruction of the distribution of atomic hydrogen in the inner Galaxy that is based on explicit radiation-transport modelling of line and continuum emission and a gas-flow model in the barred Galaxy that provides distance resolution for lines of sight toward the Galactic Center. We apply the new model of Galactic atomic hydrogen to an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission from the inner Galaxy, for which an excess at a few GeV was reported that may be related to dark matter. We find with high significance an improved fit to the diffuse gamma-ray emission observed with the Fermi-LAT, if our new HI model is used to estimate the cosmic-ray induced diffuse gamma-ray emission. The fit still requires a nuclear bulge at high significance. Once this is included there is no evidence for a dark-matter signal, be it cuspy or cored. But an additional so-called boxy bulge is still favoured by the data.  This finding is robust under the variation of various parameters, for example the excitation temperature of atomic hydrogen, and a number of tests for systematic issues.

celine.armand@unige.ch,Celine,Armand,University of Geneva,,,,4A,0,Thu 2.12.,1000,"Combined dark matter searches towards dwarf spheroidal galaxies with Fermi-LAT, HAWC, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS","Cosmological and astrophysical observations suggest that 85% of the total matter of the Universe is made of Dark Matter (DM). However, its nature remains one of the most challenging and fundamental open questions of particle physics. In the framework of indirect DM search, observations of promising targets are used to search for signatures of DM annihilation. Among these, the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are commonly favored owing to their expected high DM content and negligible astrophysical background. In this work, we present the very first combination of 20 dSph observations, performed by the Fermi-LAT, HAWC, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS collaborations in order to maximize the sensitivity of DM searches and improve the current results. We use a joint maximum likelihood approach combining each experiment’s individual analysis to derive more constraining upper limits on the WIMP DM self-annihilation cross-section as a function of DM particle mass. We present new DM constraints over the widest mass range ever reported, extending from 5 GeV to 100 TeV thanks to the combination of these five different 𝛾-ray instruments.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, Session"

They are hypothesized to be produced in high-energy environments, such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), and undergo conversion into gamma-rays in the presence of an external magnetic field, with a characteristic spectrum peaking in the 30--100-MeV energy range. CCSNe are invoked as progenitors of ordinary long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), allowing us to conduct a search for ALP spectral signatures using GRB observations with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We conduct a data-driven sensitivity analysis to find the distance limit for a hypothetical ALP detection with the LAT's low-energy technique which, in contrast to the standard LAT analysis, allows for a a larger effective area for energies down to 30~MeV. We also select a candidate sample of twenty-four GRBs and carry out a model comparison analysis. In this presentation, we will summarize the statistical methods used in our analysis and the underlying assumptions, the feasibility of the upper limits on ALP coupling from our model comparison results, and an outlook on future MeV instruments.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, Session"
elena.pinetti@edu.unito.it,Elena,Pinetti,Fermilab ,,,,4B,0,Thu 2.12.,1045,Dark filaments playing over the radio,"Clusters of galaxies are thought to be linked by extended filaments, which represent a novel target for dark matter (DM) searches. These connective structures are very faint, thus extremely difficult to detect with current telescopes. Since the location of filaments is not known a priori, a proxy for clusters is needed. Luminous red galaxies (LRGs) are valuable tracers, being usually located close to the centres of clusters.  In our work we found the first-ever robust detection of the stacked radio emission from large filaments (1-15 Mpc), connecting pairs of LRGs. The signal is compatible with synchrotron emission from filaments of the cosmic web, providing direct evidence of one of the cornerstones of our current understanding of the large-scale structure in the Universe.  We showed that the excess in the radio flux can be interpreted as synchrotron radiation from DM particles: candidates with a mass around 5-10 GeV decaying into electron-positron pairs can produce a signal compatible with the observations. We constrain the decay lifetime from the observed brightness temperatures, obtaining competitive bounds for masses in the range 3-10 GeV and magnetic fields above 130nGauss.","Indirect Detection, Contributed talk, Session"

Searches for imprints of evaporation involve several observables such as the Extragalactic Gamma-Ray background or direct measurement of different species of cosmic rays. Using these observables, one can put very tight constraints on the PBH density in a mass range around 10^14 g. To perform direct observations of the evaporation of these PBHs, one needs to be sensitive to photons in the Very High Energy gamma-ray regime, either using Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes or wide field of view shower front detectors. The Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory is a projected ground-based gamma-ray detector that will be located in the Southern Hemisphere and it is now in its design phase. In this contribution, I will show the limits on PBH evaporation that can be achieved with a straw man detector that is being considered at the moment for SWGO.","Primordial Black Holes, Contributed talk, Session"

Especially in the mass range above 10^-1 M_sun, the method using gas accretion on PBH has been taken. Here, we newly consider the gas accretion process in dust tori in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The dust torus region is typically the central ten pc region of a galaxy and contains abundant gas. These conditions are suitable for PBH constraints. As an example, we consider a nearby AGN in NGC 1068 whose gas mass in the dust torus is recently estimated as 10^5 M_sun. By setting PBH radiation do not overheat the gas in the torus, we find \Omega_{PBH}/\Omega_{DM} goes down to 3×10^-3 at ~300 M_sun. This independent constraint is comparable to previous X-ray and gas heating bounds in the literature. Our method applies to a variety of AGN torii with gas measurements.","Primordial Black Holes, Contributed talk, Session"

For primordial black holes of a certain mass, this effect has huge implications on dark matter phenomenology. I will discuss such implications in the context of models that contain one or more dark sector particles, as well as models which couple to the Standard Model. Specifically, we investigate when primordial black hole evaporation can have important effects on thermal freeze-in and out. We explore the production of spin-2 particles, entropy dilution and the potential for re-thermalization after black hole evaporation.

Their internal kinematics indicate that these are amongst the most dark matter-dominated objects in the Universe. Their relative proximity allows the collection of high-quality spectroscopic, photometric and proper motion data. These data contain crucial information on the inner structure of halos, which sets an important constraint on the particle physics properties of dark matter. However, high-resolution N-body hydrodynamics simulations suggest that the dark matter distribution in dwarf galaxies is also sensitive to the physics of galaxy formation, the details of which are not fully understood.

In this presentation we report on a new measurement of cosmic birefringence from polarisation data of the European Space
Agency (ESA)’s Planck satellite. The statistical significance of the measured signal is 2.4 sigma. If confirmed with higher statistical significance in future, it would have important implications for the elusive nature of dark matter and dark energy.","Dark Matter astrophysics, Invited talk, Session"
